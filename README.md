# Internet-Engineering-Project2

1. Goals:
Working with key Express fundamentals:

Routing (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
Middleware (express.json(), logging, error handling)
Serving static HTML/JS/CSS
Using in-memory data (array) instead of DB
RESTful design pattern

2. Project Overview:
A basic To-Do List app with:

A minimal HTML/CSS/JS frontend (no frameworks)
A backend API built with Express.js
Tasks stored in an in-memory array (so no DB setup)

For running the program:
prompt npm install
then prompt npm start and open http://localhost:3000/
